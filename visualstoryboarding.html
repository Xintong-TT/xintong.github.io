      <p>
I wanna to thank my classmates for all these suggestions and feedback, they helped a lot:)</p>
  
      <h2 id="project review">About the “green screen” itself </a></h2>
      <p>1. The official name of it: Safety net (密目网)<br/><br/>

2. Most of the things covered by safety net are looming. To wrap a thing is to give us the right to reimagine, the wrapped object itself is also got removed from the details and restored to the most essential structure.<br/><br/>

3. The safety net can protect objects falling from height. It acts as a buffer and effectively prevents falling objects from hurting the ground and workers.<br/><br/>

3.safety net is a kind of fabric, this medium is very attractive, it’s like the skin of the city.<br/><br/>

3. why green?<br/>

a. Emergency exits and safe passage signs in public places are all green. In our consciousness, green is a symbol of speed and safety.<br/>
b. In the hot summer, the dense green mesh is easy to reflect heat, which is good for cooling.<br/>
c. Green fits quite in the urban landscape.<br/>
d. it is organic color but in this situation it. is not for organic use.</p>
      

      <h2 id="project review">Some further inspiration</a></h2>

<p>1. Safey wet prevents the public from seeing the internal process.<br/><br/>
2. People prefer the final result than the process.<br/><br/>
2. Under the safety net, there are those social phenomena that our society does not allow us to see clearly.<br/><br/>
3. We can only imagine the structure of the building under the safety wet because it is covered up. It's just like those marginalized groups that only exist in our imagination, we don't know them at all, our understanding of them basically comes from our imagination.<br/><br/>
keywords of "what to do": marginalization, monumental, subliminal, inferiority, publicity
</p>

<h2 id="project review">Storyboard</a></h2>
<p>
prototype 1:<br/><br/>

Use poles to build structures in space, and use projectors to project the image on the safety net. When the audience approaches, the image & video & audio are displayed.<br/><br/>
 <img src="Storyboarding2.jpg" width="1000">

prototype 2:<br/><br/>

Wrap some items related to the marginal crowd with the safety net, and illuminate these wrapped objects with lights to make their shadow been projected to the wall. Scan the shadow on the wall with a mobile phone to see the image in the shape of the shadow.</p>

<h3 id="project review">Problems encontered</a></h3>

<p>I’m paying too much attention to the appearance of the work. The focus should actually be on how to use the characteristics of the medium itself to convey emotions. <br/>I asked for a piece of safety wet from the construction site yesterday, I’m going to “play with it” in the next few days and try to improve my concepts.</p>
