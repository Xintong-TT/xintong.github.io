      <p>After the major studio this morning, I stayed a little bit longer in our classroom to loiter about and wait for my afternoon courses. While sitting there, I found that I can't help staring at this sink. In a certain sense, this sink is quite artistic, its relationship between the composition of the countertop and the ground is interesting, the structure seems very harmonious. Itâ€™s also kind of elegant I think, even qualified to be a set of sketch still life.</p>

       <h3 id="photo">Thoughts popping up</a></h3>
       <p>
        1. How long has it been placed here?<br/>
2. Is it happening art? Does it become happening art at the moment I think it can be regarded as a work of art?<br/>
3. How did the traces on the wall shaped? Why do these streamlined ink stains appear?<br/>
4. There are vestiges in the bottom of it, what have people washed within it?<br/>
5. The paper towel on the countertop is obviously not used to clean the sink, it seems just been thrown here.<br/>
6. What brand of wash sink is this?<br/>
7. This socket looks very rebellious, half covered by the countertop, still pops out firmly. Why is it designed like this?<br/>
8. What is the connection between this sink and the round cover on its right?<br/>
9. This is the collection of the memes people left in this room.<br/>
10. If I do treat it as a work of contemporary art to appreciate, what kind of perspective shall I hold?<br/>
11.This sink is actually a time-based work, generated naturally in this space.<br/><br/>
Keywords of the sink: marginalized, neglected, artistic, polluted, full of vicissitudes.</p>

        <p>If a sink is only regarded as a sink, it will always remain an article for daily use, but if one observes it from another perspective, it can be something else.</p>
