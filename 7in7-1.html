      <p>10x10x10 is a hybridized literature work which content is completely based on random sampling.
I suddenly got the inspiration of this project when I was wandering in the Humanities and Social Sciences Library of Tsinghua University. I randomly selected ten novels of completely different genres from ten bookshelves and picked out the tenth line of their tenth articles, then I recombined these sentences into a brand new narrative.</p>
<p>Accordingly, here comes to this short article, composed of Mishima Yukio, Zhang Ailing, and George Orwell's sentences, tells a creepy story of a son who killed his serial killer father drived by his shame...</p>

      <h1 id="inspiration">Inspiration</a></h1>
      <p>I always have appetite in wired books, during the quarantine I bought a book called The Beautiful Poetry of Donald Trump by Rob Sears. It is not actual Trump's poetry, it is the remixed version by the author. Sears selected sentences from Trump's Twitter and then composited them to become poems. I think this kind of "hybrid literature" is not only interesting, but also very artistic.</p>
