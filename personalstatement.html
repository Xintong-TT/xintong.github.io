      <p>

Since I was quite young, I immersed myself in various medias such as science fiction TV series, video games, and even some cult films, I was fascinated by the unexpected images and the world of fantasy, and immediately felt a strong will to become an innovative creator in the future. Many artists and designers have inspired me, their works have made me understand how to present ideas in unique ways. The works of still and motion images, such as Hideo Kojima's game Metal Gear Solid and Matthew Barney's Cremaster Cycle series, although these two works are completely different types, they are both perfect combinations of artistry and media language, which helped me recognize the multimodal nature of artistic expression; it was also in which did I sense the critical humor and realize that art, images, and games can be developed into a harmonized combination. Especially under the influence of Hideo Kojima, I developed a great interest in the game industry.</p>

<p>With the intuition of my interests and the investigations of my undergraduate study in Central Academy of Fine Arts, I absorbed the latest VR techniques and 2D and 3D Animation, Interactive Image Creation, Image and Speculation, Dynamic Graphics and also installation art. I learned to recognize that the constantly generated art media along with traditional aesthetic creations interweave with each other, forming an invisible grid - interactive media. I am already on my way to fully understand each intersection point.</p>

<p>Under current environment, I think Virtual Reality is a very promising art form, so I started VR-related media art creating in past two years, which is also a project I will continue to work on in Parsons. The Design & Technology MFA emphasis that the discipline uses developing technology as a medium of artistic expression. It simultaneously reflects upon, challenges and innovates the form of creation. This pursuit coincides with my own identity, and stimulates my pursuit of how industrial exploration collides with thinking. I think my main purpose in DT is to explore different art forms, and then integrate the artistic way of thinking into the game industry, which I have always interested in. I noticed that although the game industry is developing rapidly in China, there is still a lack of sincere games, players nowadays are constantly investing money in junk games. Most games made by big companies like Tencent and NetEase are mostly to meet business needs, but are inevitably rigid and lacking artistry. I see developing potentials in both the art and game industries in China and think that the domestic market and profession of media art are facing a growing era, during which talents will be massively needed. In the long run, I hope my accumulation of media art will contribute to my artistic visions and drive the development of the Chinese game industry where commercial games may someday no longer dominate the market.
